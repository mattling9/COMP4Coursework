\subsection{Changes to Outline Plan}
	Some of my test series were quite brief and only tested for one variable. For example test series 3, ' Test Data is stored in the correct location' only tests whether the data is stored in the correct location. Because i am storing encrypted passwords, and data that must be in a specific format, such as dates, i have change this test series to: 'Test data is stored in the correct format and is in the correct storage location'. \par

 Looking at my original test plan, there are many aspects of my system in which i am not testing. One area which is not being tested is the emailing functionality. I need to test whether the emails are being sent to the correct email address, and that the contents of the email address are appropriate. For example i don't want the system to send an email to a user their account details, when i actually want to send them an email containing an invoice. Therefore i have added a test series to test the emailing functionality. \par

During the implementation process i added keyboard shortcuts to increase the speed of flow of control between the interfaces. In my original outline plan there were no test to see if these keyboard shortcuts work as they should. Therefore, i have added a new test series to test the functionalilty of the keyboard shortcuts. \par

Below is a table to show the changes i have made to the original outline plan created during the design phase. Any Test series that have been modified are highlighted in dark grey  and any new test series added have been highlighted in light grey.

\subsection{Original Detailed Plan}

the table below shows my original test plan made during the design phase. Since the design phase i have implemented my system and made alterations to the features described during the design phase. Because of these changes made, i have removed some tests from my original test plan as they have become redundant due to the changes made during the implementation stage. Some tests have been removed because they require a few modifications to suit my system after the implementation stage, both the removed and modified tests are described in the 'Changes to Detailed Plan' section.

\subsection{Changes to Detailed Plan}

Since i created my original outline plan during the design phase, i have add two new test plans. This means i shall now need to include more tests to my detailed plan to test each feature in the new test series. As stated before, i have removed some test series as since the implementation stage, i have made a few modifications to my system. The tests in which i have removed have been highlighted in dark grey. Any tests that i have added have been highlighted in light grey.
