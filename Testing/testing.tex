\subsection{Changes to Outline Plan}
	Some of my test series were quite brief and only tested for one variable. For example test series 3, ' Test Data is stored in the correct location' only tests whether the data is stored in the correct location. Because i am storing encrypted passwords, and data that must be in a specific format, such as dates, i have change this test series to: 'Test data is stored in the correct format and is in the correct storage location'. \par

 Looking at my original test plan, there are many aspects of my system in which i am not testing. One area which is not being tested is the emailing functionality. I need to test whether the emails are being sent to the correct email address, and that the contents of the email address are appropriate. For example i don't want the system to send an email to a user their account details, when i actually want to send them an email containing an invoice. Therefore i have added a test series to test the emailing functionality. \par

During the implementation process i added keyboard shortcuts to increase the speed of flow of control between the interfaces. In my original outline plan there were no test to see if these keyboard shortcuts work as they should. Therefore, i have added a new test series to test the functionalilty of the keyboard shortcuts. \par

Below is a table to show the changes i have made to the original outline plan created during the design phase. Any Test series that have been modified are highlighted in dark grey  and any new test series added have been highlighted in light grey.

\subsection{Original Detailed Plan}

the table below shows my original test plan made during the design phase. Since the design phase i have implemented my system and made alterations to the features described during the design phase. Because of these changes made, i have removed some tests from my original test plan as they have become redundant due to the changes made during the implementation stage. Some tests have been removed because they require a few modifications to suit my system after the implementation stage, both the removed and modified tests are described in the 'Changes to Detailed Plan' section.

\subsection{Changes to Detailed Plan}

Since i created my original outline plan during the design phase, i have add two new test plans. This means i shall now need to include more tests to my detailed plan to test each feature in the new test series. As stated before, i have removed some test series as since the implementation stage, i have made a few modifications to my system. The tests in which i have removed have been highlighted in dark grey. Any tests that i have added have been highlighted in light grey.

\subsection{Changes to Test Data}
	
Because i have added two new test series in my new outline plan, i have added new test data for the new tests added. I have also included more erroneous and boundary as i only have one or two of each in my original test data. Some tests in the original test plan include entering many pieces of data in the same test. In the new test plan, i have removed any unnecessary tests and broken any tests containing multiple pieces of test data, up into their own individual tests. I have also updated the Justifications for a lot of the tests as they either were too brief or did not make sense. Any test data i have removed has been highlighted in dark grey and any new test data has been highlighted in light grey. I have also changed the test series of the tests to match the test series for the new detailed plan.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \caption{Decrypting the password from the new employee account in the database.} \label{fig:test-307-4}

\vspace{5mm}
  i decided to encrypt the passwords for the accounts before they are stored so that people cannot just use to database inspector to find out the passwords for all the accounts. I used a simple Caesar Cypher code to encrypt and decrypt the passwords within the system. Each letter in the password is changed to the letter three places up in the alphabet. For example and A is changed to a D. The table below shows the transformation for all the characters. The rows highlighted in light grey are the rows that will be needed to decrypt the password: `sdvvzrug'.

\vspace{5mm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{3.5cm}|p{3.5cm}|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Before Encryption} & \textbf{After Encryption} \\ \hline
       \rowcolor{light-grey} a & d \\ \hline
        b & e\\ \hline
        c & f\\ \hline
       \rowcolor{light-grey} d & g\\ \hline
        e & h\\ \hline
        f & i\\ \hline
        g & j\\ \hline
        h & k\\ \hline
        i & l\\ \hline
        j & m\\ \hline
        k & n\\ \hline
        l & o\\ \hline
        m & p\\ \hline
        n & q\\ \hline
       \rowcolor{light-grey} o & r\\ \hline
       \rowcolor{light-grey}p & s\\ \hline
       q & t\\ \hline
      \rowcolor{light-grey}  r & u\\ \hline
      \rowcolor{light-grey}  s & v\\ \hline
        t & w\\ \hline
        u & x\\ \hline
        v & y\\ \hline

        x & a\\ \hline
        y & b\\ \hline
        z & c\\ \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \end{center}
 \vspace{5mm}
 Looking at the the After Encryption column in the table and changing the letters to the letters in the before encryption table,  we can see that S decrypts to P, D decrypts to A, V decrypts to S, Z decrypts to W, R decrypts to O, U decrypts to R and G decrypts to D. By changing the password `sdvvzrug' to its decrypted form, we can see that the password before encryption was `password' this is the result that we wanted from the test.

\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Approach to Testing}

I have chosen to take a mixed level approach, in attempt to to test all areas of my system and find as many faults as possible. For example,  The tests in series 1 are examples of Top Down Testing, testing the flow of control between the user interfaces of my system so my client can get to the interface easily and quickly (One of the general objectives of the system).Series 2 uses Bottom Up testing to test the validation of the data inputs. This is a critical test for some data fields as data entered from the user is manipulated by the system and any invalid data entered will me the data may not be able to be manipulated. For example when a customer buys X amount of a product, the stock of the product needs to be changed. Here a calculation is made to work out the new stock of the product, if the stock was entered as a string by the user, this calculation cannot be made. Series 3 uses white box testing i have to look into the database to ensure the data has been stored successfully and correctly. Series 4, 5 and 6 use black box testing to ensure that any processes that happen within the system work successfully and correctly.

\subsection{Problems Encountered}

during the Testing phase i exposed some problems within my system, these problems are specified below along with the measures i underwent to eliminate these issues. 

\textbf{Test Series 2.01}

In Test series 2.01 i tested to see which characters were eligible for Product Name. Realistically only Letters should be accepted not numbers or special characters. The evidence for this test can be found on page \pageref{fig:test-201-1} figure \ref{fig:test-201-1}, page \pageref{fig:test-201-2} figure \ref{fig:test-201-2} and  page \pageref{fig:test-201-3} figure \ref{fig:test-201-3}. To fix this problem i simply need to amend the regular expression, so that it only allows letters. 


\textbf{Test Series 2.02}

In test series 2.02, any file type is accepted by the system. However, unless the file is an image file an image will not be displayed. If the user chooses a file which is not an image file, no message is displayed and the system doesn't display an image. The changes that need to be made in order for this test to work, is that if the file is not an image file, do not try to change the current image and display a message to the user saying they need to choose an image file. The system could also restrict the user from choosing and other file than an image file. This could be implemented in a future version of my system.

\textbf{Test Series 2.03}

In Test Series 2.03, I tested to see the boundaries for a valid price. The evidence from this test series can be found on  page \pageref{fig:test-203-1} figure \ref{fig:test-203-1}, page \pageref{fig:test-203-2} figure \ref{fig:test-203-2}, page \pageref{fig:test-203-3} figure \ref{fig:test-203-3} and page \pageref{fig:test-203-4} figure \ref{fig:test-203-4}. Realistically this should have been between £0.00 and £999.99. However during the Implementation stage i did not set a boundary to the price. Because of this i was able to enter a huge price which should not be allowed. To solve this i need to simply put an if statement every time the user changes the text. To do this I can say: QLineEdit.textChanged.connect(self.check-length). Now to make sure the price is between the limits i need to add: IF self.price < 999.99 THEN: to the self.check-length method. if the price is less than 999.99 then i need to change the QLineEdit boarder to green. This can be done by applying a style-sheet to that specific QLineEdit.

Also in test series 2.03, the user can enter a price into the price field. I used a built in validator that only allows integers from the keyboard to be entered. However this module allows the use of an exponential to be entered, which allows the user to enter the letter 'e'. This means that this test failed as it should only accept integers. To change this, i need to tell the validator which notation to use. At the moment it uses both standard and scientific notation. The scientific notation is what allows the user to enter the letter 'e'. To stop this from happening i need to set the notation to just the standard notation. This can be done easily by simply doing self.price-validator.standardNotation() where self.price-validator is a QDoubleValidator.

\textbf{Test Series 2.05}

In test series 2.05, the only acceptable characters in the members name should be letters. special characters or numbers should not be accepted. At the moment, special characters are not accepted however letters and numbers are. This has been evidenced on page \pageref{fig:test-205-1} figure: \ref{fig:test-205-1}  and page \pageref{fig:test-205-2} figure: \ref{fig:test-205-2}. To change this, i need to change the regular expression so that integers should not be accepted. The regular should look along the lines of this: "[A-Z]{1,18}" where the A-Z is the range  of acceptable characters and 1-18 is the amount of characters allowed. 

\textbf{Test Series 2.08}

When the member enters their postcode, They have the ability to search for their address if they live im Cumbria. However, the postcodes stored in the CSV file have spaces in. The postcode field still validates the postcode even if there is no space in it. Therefore the user could enter their postcode and because it does not have a space in it, it won't be found. for example if 'CB7 5LQ' was stored in the CSV file and the user entered 'CB75LQ' it would not be found. To solve this problem i should change all of the postcodes in the CSV so they do not have spaces in. Then when the user enters their postcode, remove the space if there is one. This can be done by doing 'postcode-input.replace(" ",""). This would now allow the user to either enter the postcode with or without a space and it will still be able to be found in the CSV file.

\textbf{Test Series 2.09}

In Test series 2.09 i tested the range of characters that were acceptable for the house number. Originally i thought that only integers should be accepted in this field. Since the implementation stage, i have realised that houses can also contain letters as well. for example there could be a 66A or a 66B or the house could have a house name instead of a number which the user could not specify in my current system. Therefore,  this test has failed. To improve this feature, i should change the the input method so that the user can also enter characters in the field as well.

\textbf{Test Series 3.05}

Test series 3.05 relates to the test Series 2.09. Ideally i want every postcode to be stored without a space between them. Currently the user can choose to enter a space or not which will mean that some will be stored with a space between and some will not. This issue will be resolved if the changes to test series 2.09 are made.

\textbf{Test Series 6.06}

Test Series 6.06 tests the menu that is displayed when the user right clicks on an Employee in the search window. When logged in on an account that is not the Administrators, the user should not be able to access the Add Edit And Delete Employee. However, when the user right clicks on an Employee they are given the option to edit or delete an Employee. This should not happen, instead i want these options to be greyed out if the user is not signed in as the administrator. To do this, when the user right clicks on one of the Employees, a function is run to display the menu to the user. To solve this problem, i need to check whether the user is signed in as the administrator and then choose whether to display the edit and delete Employee options or grey them out. I already have a function that returns the EmployeeID of the currently logged in user, i can use this to check who is currently logged in. I can then use an if statement stating: IF EmployeeID != 1 THEN. Now i need to say what must happen if they are not signed in on the administrators account, in this case i want to grey out the menu options, which can be done by doing: QMenuItem.setDisabled(True)



\subsection{Strengths of Testing}

The main strengths of my testing is the rigorous testing of the data inputs and outputs of the system, ensuring the features of highest importance were working correctly. Another strength from my testing was the rigorous testing of the flow of control between the user interfaces, which showed that my system can be navigated quickly and easily. The rigorous testing of the data inputs and outputs of the system means i can conclude that this area of the system is effective. From the testing I managed to identify many problems and faults within my system. Knowing about these faults and knowing where they lie will be a good aid, in fixing the problems my client has with the system.

\subsection{Weaknesses of Testing}

The main weakness from my testing was due to the fact i did not have time to test every feature within my system. This could result in features not working properly. I Attempted to overcome this problem during Test series 7.01, where the program was used generically, i discovered no big problems during normal use of the system, all features work appropriately apart from a few small problems outlined during the testing and the, if any, undiscovered problems.

\subsection{Reliability of Application}

From my testing i have found my application to be considerably reliable. I tested most of data inputs of the system and all of them worked correctly, even though some of have some validation problems.An example of data fields that have validation problems can be found on page \pageref{fig:test-201-2} figure \ref{fig:test-201-2},  \pageref{fig:test-203-2} figure \ref{fig:test-203-2} and \pageref{fig:test-205-2} figure \ref{fig:test-205-2}. All of the data inputs stored the data under the correct table column and all the data was stored in valid format, either just for storing and being output to the user, or being used for  calculations. \par

The validation used on the data inputs has ensured that the data being input from these data fields is reliable. An example of a data field that has validation is the stock field for adding a product to the system. Testing the validator to ensure it works can be found on page \pageref{fig:test-204-2}, figure \ref{fig:test-204-2}.
I was not able to validate all of the data inputs for the system, however,  validation has been used for every field when adding or editing a product, member or employee. This ensures that all the data stored within the system for each product member and employee is reliable. Ensuring that the product, member and employee have been validated are of the highest importance because this shall be where the majority of the data shall be input.\par

An example of a data field that is not validated is the gmail email used to send emails from the system. I did not have time to test normal, boundary and erroneous data for this field and i know i did not implement any validation for this data input, which means the user can enter anything into this data field. However, although it will be accepted in this field, unless the email address is a real email address, and the email address and the password match an existing gmail account, the system will not be able to send the email to the client anyway.


\subsection{Robustness of Application}

My testing programme has also proved that my system is very robust. During the testing, my program never crashed or returned error messages when attempting to do something. One way in which the system could crash is if data is entered in the wrong format. This would be applicable for my system for the stock of the products, if they were entered as a string, the system could not work out how much of a product can be added to one order, the sales for each week / day. This is also applicable for any other data types that are required to be entered as a integer, due to that data being used for a calculation within the system. Evidence that some data can only be entered as an integer can be found on page \pageref{fig:test-209-2}, figure:\ref{fig:test-209-2}. I found that entering string where an integer is needed was a problem during the early stages of the Implementation, and ensured that i resolved the problem, as well as ensuring i did not encounter this problem later on in the Implementation stage. Therefore, during the testing phase, i did not encounter any problems with the format of data. The image below shows the result if the stock was entered as a string and the stock from the two locations were added together.

\end{figure}

This was the first problem i encountered during the Implementation stage, which was hard to debug because it did not create an error when the two stocks are added together. However, once a customer bought a product from the company the system broke because it could not do the subtraction of "twelvethree - X" where X is the amount of the product bought as an integer. The system presented me with the following message when this happened:
