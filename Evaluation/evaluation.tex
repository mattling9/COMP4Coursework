\subsection{General Objective Evaluation}

\subsubsection{Data can added to the database easily}
\textbf{Was the Objective Fulfilled?} \newline

This objective has been fulfilled successfully. The data fields have been labeled so that the user knows what data they need to enter into the field. Evidence for this can be in figure \ref{fig:}. The information in which the user must enter has been grouped together in a group box, for the convenience of the user, which is evidenced in figure \ref{fig:} . The system clearly shows when the user has entered valid or non valid data by creating a green border around each data field. Evidence for the current validation for my system can be found in figure \ref{fig:}. Adding a Product Employee and a Member are all done in a similar fashion which reduces the time having to learn how to add each aspect to the system. The system will clearly state whether the product, member or employee has been added successfully or not.
\textbf{Evidence} \newline

\subsubsection{Data can be edited within the system easily.}
\textbf{Was the Objective Fulfilled?} \newline

This objective has been fulfilled. The user has to enter the ID of the item they would like to edit, and the edit interface will allow them to change the data. As specified above, the data inputs have been grouped together which is convenient for the user, the edit interface also has a clear edit button in the bottom right hand corner of the interface in which the user can click when they have finished editing the information. The button is bright green which means it is obvious for the user to see.
