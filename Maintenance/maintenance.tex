\subsection{Usage Explanation}

\textbf{Python 3}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is The Programming Language i am most familiar with.
	\item The Software is free to download
	\item Python is avaiable on all system platforms. Meaning the program can still be used if my client changes operating systems.
	\item There are a lot of pre installed modules, that i could use which means the user does not have to install many extra modules for my system to work.
	\item Python is an object orientated programming language
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Idle}
\begin{itemize}

	\item Can be used to create simple single user used databases.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}


\textbf{SQLiteInspector}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A Database inspect is not required for my client, however i used this software as it made observing data inputs into the database a lot easier.
	\item SQLiteInspector allowed me to test SQL Queries before implementing them into my system.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}

\pagebreak

\textbf{Adobe Photoshop CS6}
\begin{itemize}
	\item the photo editing software that i am most confident using and familiar with.
	\item Allowed to me to create high resolution images that could be saved as a .png
	\item images can be saved with transparencies to remove backgrounds from my images.
	\item Comes with a huge variety of tools which meant i did not have to install any addition tools to create the graphics for my system.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}


\textbf{Microsoft Excel}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A spreadsheet program in which i am familiar with, that allowed me to Edit the CSV file.
	\item The spreadsheet program in which i am most familiar with, did not allow me to open the CSV file because it was too large. Excel allowed me to open it with no problems.
	\item Allows you to save files as .csv files which allowed me to open and edit the CSV file.
	\item is a very widely used piece of software which means that lots of solutions and help is available, if i wasn't sure how to do something when using the software.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}


\textbf{Notepad}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Comes pre-installed on all Windows based computers.
	\item Is the text editor i am most familiar with and is extremely easy to use.
	\item Allows you to save your file as a huge variety of different file types, although i only needed to save it as a .txt file, which is very common.
	\item although it is only available on Windows systems, there are many of similar plain text editors that will do the same job that i needed, but can be used on other Operating systems.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Notepad ++}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is available on Windows operating systems, in which both me and my client currently use.
	\item Allows documents to be exported as .html which is what i needed to use it for.
	\item it allowed me to preview my HTML invoice easily and quickly.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}


\textbf{Google Chrome}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is available to download free, on all operating systems
	\item once chrome is installed, nothing else is required for it to function properly
	\item Is a very popular search engine, meaning many know how to use the software.
	\item Allowed me to see what my HTML invoice would look like.
	\item is supported by Notepad ++ which allowed me to preview my invoice quickly.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Features Used}

\textbf{Python 3}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is an object orientated programming language
	\item Has a wide selection of built in functions and modules in which i could use, for example the random and time module.
	\item Python 3 has some improved features compared to Python 2 such as not being able to compare between string and integers and floats.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}


\textbf{IDLE}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is an object orientated programming language
	\item Has a wide selection of built in functions and modules in which i could use, for example the random and time module.

\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Microsoft Excel}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Has a search feature which allowed me to find the information i wanted easily, which was useful because the CSV file was extremely large.
	\item Microsoft Excel allows you to delete entire rows or entire columns, this is very useful when managing a large spreadsheet.
	\item Allows you to Find words and replace them with others. This proved useful when I wanted to capitalise the name of the towns within the CSV file.
